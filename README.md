## Aim

To create a open, extendible and human readable format for the logging of scuba
dives.

To develop a suite of tools around this format for data import, processing and
presentation

## Why

I've always kept track of my dives through a paper log or via a spreadsheet.
While a valid solution I wanted to extend the capabilities beyond what a
two dimensional spreadsheet can offer.

As a lifelong hobby the solution needs to be open and platform agnostic. I could
not rely on a commercial software solution to preserve this data.

## State

This project is in very early development, issues and PRs are still very
welcome.

While recreational diving using air is simple to log the addition of multiple
gasses, closed circuit systems and other technical details will prolong the
development time of this standard.

Importing data from other software packages and hardware dive computers will be
ever changing and there is great scope for the presentation of the log data.
